# Stokes Flow of an Evolving Fluid Film with Arbitrary Shape and Topology
This repository provides a minimal MATLAB implementation of a fluid membrane undergoing Helfrich-Stokes relaxation, as described in the paper:

**Stokes Flow of an Evolving Fluid Film with Arbitrary Shape and Topology**

*Cuncheng Zhu, David Saintillan, and Albert Chern*

## Getting Started
This implementation relies on the following key components:
* `Mesh.m`: Constructs the halfedge data structure for a triangular manifold mesh.
* `Geometry.m`: Computes geometric attributes of the $\mathbb{R}^3$-embedded mesh and the spatial differential operators for an evolving surface.
* `spheroid.m`, `genus6.m`: The main executable that performs the variational time integration.

## Prerequisites
To run this code, you will need:
* MATLAB
* The [`sptensor`](https://www.tensortoolbox.org/sptensor_doc.html) library for efficient storage and manipulation of sparse multidimensional arrays.
* [`MATLAB Isotropic Remesher`](https://github.com/christopherhelf/isotropicremeshing?tab=readme-ov-file#matlab-isotropic-remesher) (optional) for remeshing when detecting non-Delaunay meshes. 
Note that this remesher is based on OpenMesh 5.0, a legacy version of OpenMesh.
Refer to `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md` for installation instructions. 

## Running the Code
1. Clone this repository:
```Bash
git clone https://github.com/CunchengZhu/Evolving-Stokes-flow-2024.git
```
2. Load a driver script (e.g., `spheroid.m`, `genus6.m`)
3. Execute the script to start the simulation.

## Visualization
* **MATLAB Visualization**: Use the built-in `trisurf` function to visualize the triangular mesh and the `quiver` function to display the fluid velocity. 
* **External Tools**: For advanced visualization, export the mesh data and use tools like [Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com/download/). Learn more about Houdini with this [Introduction to Houdini](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~alchern/teaching/houdini/).
